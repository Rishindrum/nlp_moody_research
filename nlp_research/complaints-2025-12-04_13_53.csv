I am requesting an immediate investigation into upstart and XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( FDIC # XXXX ), Finwise Banks ( FDIC # XXXX ), and DR Banks ( FDIC # XXXX ) due diligence failures under FDIC Part 364 II. Relman Colfax Reports Proof of Bias and Experimental Model : According to public reports from XXXX XXXX XXXX, the independent Civil Rights Law Firm serving as the Fair Lending Monitor for Upstarts lending model, Upstarts platform relies on Machine Learning ( ML ) and Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) to evaluate creditworthiness using non-traditional data, including factors such as educational background. This data set has been widely criticized as reinforcing XXXX and socioeconomic bias. 


In the Final Monitoring Report released on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX makes the following points that are critical to this complaint : Upstart 's AI model was not fully vetted or validated for XXXX fairness before XXXX. 

The model used by Upstart ( and, by extension, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX DR Bank ) lacks a viable, less discriminatory alternative, raising serious concerns about algorithmic discrimination. 

Despite extended discussions, the Parties remain at an impasse about how to assess the discriminatory impact of Upstarts model.

The Monitor recommends that XXXX apply its methodology to future algorithm changes, indicating the current system is still evolving and experimental. 

Additional findings from the Monitors four-year oversight include : Statistical evidence of bias : XXXX applicants faced statistically significant approval disparities ( Adverse Impact Ratio, or AIR XXXX XXXX ) in every quarter from XXXX. XXXX and XXXX  applicants were also harmed, but XXXX prioritized model performance over corrective action. ( Third Report, p.24 ) Hidden proxies for race : The AI model contains hidden proxy variables such as ZIP code, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) attendance, and SAT/ACT scores that serve as indirect indicators of race, a clear sign of Educational algorithmic redlining. ( Initial Report, p.21 ) Discriminatory pricing : HBCU/HSI graduates were charged an average of {$3400.00} more than graduates from elite institutions like NYU despite having identical financial profiles. ( Initial Report, p.21 ) Regulatory noncompliance : Upstart ignored the CFPBs No-Action Letter ( NAL ) stipulations , including the requirement to test its algorithm for XXXX bias. They also rejected the Monitors proposed XXXX XXXX, which had been shown to reduce XXXX applicant disparities by 40 %. ( Initial Report, XXXX ) These practices violate : XXXX ( XXXX C.F.R. XXXX ( a ) ) CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX CFPB No-Action Letter conditions from XXXX Despite being fully aware of these findings, XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX DR Bank XXXX and FinWise Bank XXXX XXXX of which are Federally regulated institutions, failed to conduct an independent audit of the model for bias or compliance with FDICs Part XXXX on identity theft red flags and anti-discrimination safeguards.

I was going from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX XXXX to XXXX XXXX New Jersey ) to XXXX. I used my credit card for buying some food at XXXX and XXXX. 
It seems that there was a XXXX vending machine which might have done some dummy {$10.00} transactions ( 3 in number ) and none of them were successful. As it is XXXX and personal emergency plus being in XXXX ( away ) from USA - I have no way to contact Citi Master card. I am having this card for at least 5+ years. 
Later I saw that Citi Master card reached out to me and expected to do the dispute for this authorization kind of charges from XXXX. It was expected that if i want to dispute them - I am forced with a new credit card being delivered to my USA address XXXX XXXX TX ). For me it is unacceptable to get a replacement card in USA- I just wanted to continue the services with this little inconvenience ( may be {$30.00} kind of 3 charges of {$10.00} each from XXXX XXXX rather than getting a replacement card being sent to my USA address and I am not having any credit card in XXXX as I am not sure how long I am here in XXXX now ( 3 weeks or 2 months ). 

What i am seeing is that Citi master card blocked my account access. This block means blocking Citi master card as well as Costco Citi visa card. My family is still in USA and they have mine Citi Costco VISA card for costco and other purchases. 

This is so ridiculous that Citi want me to call them in USA ( i can't make international calls ) and go thru some useless IVR/Robot to get nothing out of it. 
Why can't Citi upgrade their Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to do better fraud detection.

Upon examining the response from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/year>, I have concluded that it is inadequate and unjust.The investigation process appears to be biased against me as the victim, and lacks knowledge of good industry practices and compassion towards me as a customer. 
Your response seems to be based on a flawed understanding of my situation, and crucial information that contradicts your position. The decision made in relation to the issue I raised did not consider my vulnerability as a victim of financial crime and XXXX XXXX to protect its clients from such crimes. 
Financial institutions have a duty to conduct business with due skill, care, and diligence, and Wells Fargo 's subpar intervention in my case clearly falls short of reasonable business conduct.I am not looking for a debate about what could have been done, but rather a transparent, evidence-based investigation that considers my vulnerability, the sophistication of the scam, the shortcomings of FSMA to identify fraudulent companies, and Wells Fargo 's failure to identify suspicious transactions in a timely manner.

When determining what is reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability and consider the following common queries : whether Wells Fargo neglected any rule, law, or regulation that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; whether they owed a fiduciary duty to me and breached it ; whether they promoted the questionable transaction despite being aware of its nature ; whether they were in compliance with their own policies and procedures ; whether they owed duties to me, the scope of those duties, and whether they failed to uphold them ; whether their conduct was unfair ; and whether they have the ability and should compensate me for the harm that has occurred. 

I hope that you will take these key points into account to reach a fair outcome.Wells Fargo had sufficient information available to justify and had the capability of stopping these payments altogether, but chose not to.

1. Educate clients : Banks can provide educational resources to their clients to help them identify and avoid scams.

This can include tips on how to recognize phishing emails, how to protect personal information, and how to avoid fraudulent investment schemes.

2. Implement security measures : Banks should have robust security measures in place, such as multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access to client accounts. They should also regularly monitor client accounts for any suspicious activity and notify clients immediately if any suspicious activity is detected.

3. Increase fraud detection : Banks should invest in advanced fraud detection systems to detect and prevent scams. This can include using artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify patterns of fraudulent activity.

4. Collaborate with law enforcement : Banks can work with law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute scammers. They can also share information about scams to help prevent future incidents.

5. Provide immediate assistance : In the event that a client falls victim to a scam, banks should provide immediate assistance to help mitigate the impact. This can include freezing accounts, cancelling transactions, and providing financial support to clients.

Misplaced Accountability : Victims of scams are often limited in their ability to react, as they instinctively and immediately respond to the demands of the perpetrator. It can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to consciously refrain from such reactions. Giving off signals that make us vulnerable to these schemes is not the same as being grossly negligent, given the increasingly sophisticated nature of scams that are pervasive in society.

In my case, personal circumstances made me particularly vulnerable during the victimization period, as I was financially illiterate and inexperienced in the finance sector. This made me a prime target for criminal enterprises in this field. Since then, I have gained a greater understanding of the scope and nature of these crimes and the operations of the financial services sector on an international level.

Financial institutions are well aware of the risks posed by these crimes to their clients, who may have limited knowledge of these dangers. It is important to note that victims of scams are not individuals who have made poor investment decisions, but rather individuals who have been tricked, lied to, deceived, and emotionally manipulated. Sophisticated and aggressive sales techniques can trap unsuspecting victims who are unable to escape until most or all of their funds have been lost or stolen by the scammers. A good comparison is to a perpetrator who "" grooms '' their victim while also assaulting them and preventing them from escaping.

The grounds upon which you refute my claim : Upon scrutiny, it is evident that your claims are flawed in attempting to thoroughly investigate the available facts, let alone provide an accurate portrayal of the role of Financial Institutions in fighting financial crime and fraud, your organization 's services, and other pertinent details regarding our relationship and its historical context. By focusing on inadequate due diligence checks, inconsequential references, and one-dimensional thinking, you present a distorted view of my fundamental rights as a customer, and offer a poor model for comprehending the issue in a well-reasoned and objective manner.

This approach also serves as a deficient guide to determining whether any wrongdoing occurred on your part.

Regarding the "" authorization '' argument, you argue that statements such as "" the transaction has been authorized '' and "" the duty of care has been breached '' are incompatible.

However, you have not demonstrated that these statements are logically contradictory or improbable with regard to each other. They are not mutually exclusive when considered in the broader context.

The view that my authorization of the transaction renders me fully liable oversimplifies the situation and overlooks other relevant factors related to the breach of duty of care. Clearly, there are additional facts that must be taken into account beyond what initially appears.

Conclusion : Finally, as the foregoing analysis shows, Wells Fargos grossly negligent failure to stop the fraud in question played a key role in causing my damages. Wells Fargo compounded such failures by making improper factual determinations and wrongfully rejecting the allegations made. Wells Fargos failure to propose remedial action to achieve a just outcome in my case, as well as their ineffective assistance has resulted in my incurring staggering losses and runs contrary to their purported longstanding commitment to protecting the integrity and fairness of the market against any abuses.

I formally request, in the name of justice as well as the points made above, that my case proceed with mediation/arbitration so that no party ends up suffering as a result of unjust actions and the refusal of anyone to take the basic responsibilities for enabling this to happen/doing nothing to set things right.

The information provided should meet the criteria for these reconsiderations.

If despite these objections, my concerns are not appropriately taken into consideration and are instead simply dismissed, you can be assured that alternative action will be taken, and I will make it a point to share our exchanges with the public so that at least pre-emptive action can be taken by other potential clients to avoid any dealings with organizations where customer security is not a priority.

I received a bill from Navient last month stating that my in school deferment had ended on my loan, as the in school deferment option had ended on my loan and that the loan documents stated that there was only a 2 year period of in school deferment. This is odd, because I obviously have exceeded the 2 year in school deferment from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. When I called to discuss this option I was informed of this and was treated rudely, even when I asked why this provision was being enforced now?

However, the second was not to my knowledge.

However, XXXX began developing a set of ediscovery standards that actually began after these matters and is currently in the process of updating and implementing more for example standards XXXX and XXXX. I inputted my account numbers into this process, XXXX and also prior to this XXXX. Due to unusual security issues I think it could be better to disclose when I have that. Unfortunately, I was violated during a medical procedure but interestingly implanted with a cortical modem I believe. Some of the ediscovery process could interact. I obviously was not aware of this aspect of the procedure but I do believe groups involved have attempted to use whatever means they could to procure elevated security access to frame me to maintain it. Hence anything associated with those accounts or purchases made. However, I believe those at JP Morgan the actual bank could be apart of the groups involved attempting to finance a takeover of my projects and relying on their access here to access other bills. They are doing this while I believe they know I am entitled to money and payment and instead are blocking and lying about this while attempting to prolong a situation. Some of those involved are connected to XXXX University. For example, I recently named XXXX XXXX who is a former acquaintance from XXXX University, and I think could be someone using those loans or at the Department of XXXX to attempt to delay and deny me clarity and resolve. Other things like SARMS and PEPTIDES where there were proxy investigation such as osta gain etc could be pathways to justify also.

03/10/21,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I opened a Capital One Credit Card in XX/XX/XXXX, at the time of opening the card there was an erroneous collection on my account and charge off that was due to fraud. Late XXXX I removed these charges permanently off my credit card my credit instantly rose to XXXX. 

I added my husband as an authorized user as soon as I opened the card and Capital One seamed you be very interested in who he was to me. With my new high credit score I applied to get an increase with my credit limit and was consistently denied, I applied for a new credit card with capital one I was also denied because I had such a low limit and I was spending so much money each month I exhausted all of my credit utilization and my score dropped. Capital One continued to give me bogus reasons why they were denying me, but I believe it to be caused by my sexuality. 
In their denial letters they left empty bullet points as if they were going to add all of the reasons later. I complained multiple times with Capital Ones customer service and flat out accused them of biais starting in XXXX of XXXX. I spoke to an escalation department representative in the beginning of the fall sometime and she promised me she would do something to increase my limit. 

In the fall of XXXX, I was harassed by Capital One to sign up for a supposedly pre-approved Savor card. I assumed this was resultant of my efforts with the escalation department however the card was not the credit card I was hoping for in terms of rewards. 

Capital One sent me multiple pet approved offer letters, multiple emails and finally put a non removable banner advertisement for the preapproved card offer on my capital one mobile app. I could not escape it and would see every time I went in to make a payment or check my account daily. I called to inquire with the representative about the card and I was told that my Quicksilver card would be upgraded if I accepted their preapproved offer which was based on my previous quick silver application and stellar payment history. I hadnt upgraded the card previously because I thought I should be eligible for a more superior venture card. 

I finally decided to accept their preapproved offer and immediately got an inquiry on my credit report, I called Capital One immediately and asked why I received an inquiry on my credit report as I thought I was upgrading my current account. They explained to me that I had inadvertently signed up for a brand new credit card account. I was not happy about this, because of the new inquiry my credit score went down, however I was happy to have a credit card with a high balance that I could use regularly without hurting my credit score because of high utilization due to the extremely low balance. 

I was approved for their Savor credit card, which was very confusing to me because I thought I was already pre-approved. I started using the card immediately. I placed several transactions on the card and was even sent the card in the mail and a pre-approval approval email which solidified their express and or implied contract. 

A few days after Capital Ones approval of their pre-approval Capital One said that they needed me to submit my IRS tax transcripts because they needed to verify suspicious transactions on my account I ask the representatives many times why an IRS transcript is needed to verify suspicious transactions, I told him I was willing to submit my passport, my marriage certificate, my husbands passport and both our birth certificates however Capital One wanted said they needed these items to verify suspicious transactions on my account. I have tried for months sending Capital One certified letters with legal threats as well as emails and calls to every department in Capital One. In XXXX Capital One closed my account without giving me any reason. 

It is my belief that I am being denied because of the authorized user on my account because my husband is an immigrant with a fresh SSN and little credit history and because we are a XXXX couple. Even if a company representative didnt directly make these decisions a computer systems may have. Capital One openly admits using machine learning and artificial intelligence in these decision algorithms. They use very same algorithms as the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  used in the recent scandal. XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX gave XXXX own co-founder XXXX XXXX a credit limit 10 times more than his wife who had a better score while it gave other husbands who also made complaints complaints 20-40 times credit than their wives. 

XXXX : XXXX A survey by XXXX showed that 62 % of XXXX people have experienced difficulties get approved for a credit card or a loan because of their XXXX status. This is despite the fact that XXXX people make more money on average than heterosexuals, have higher credit scores, and are less risky financially overall than heterosexuals. XXXX people also get charged a higher interest rate. XXXX borrowers are 73 percent more likely to be denied mortgage according to research despite being less risky overall, same-sex borrowers are less likely to get a mortgage. When they are approved, they face higher interest. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Capital one has violated their own express/implied contract by reengaging their pre-approved offer after offer, acceptance and consideration. I made purchases on the card, they sent me the card and then the took the card away the card until I had the IRS verify my income. If IRS transcripts could be requested after the fact there should have been some notification. Capital One has refused to disclose the reason for their obvious income verification in recorded telephone conversations and when pressured on these reasons they have changed the narrative that they need the IRS tax transcripts to verify suspicions transactions. I have recordings of their representatives saying this. This is implausible because the only IRS tax transcripts available would be from XXXX which I didnt have the card until XX/XX/XXXX and even if I had the card in XXXX I doubt I deducted my suspicious XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX transaction. Capital One has violated Equal Opportunity Credit Act by not giving me a reason for my after the fact retroactive denial and breach of implied/express contract within 30-60 days as prescribed by law. Capital One is also violating 15 U.S. Code 1637 in regards to disclosure and major changes to an agreement in ( i ) 2. Capital One also violates regulation Z in addition to clearly falsely advertising a pre-approved credit card that clearly needs to be approved and is not pre-approved. It also appears that when the card is pre-approved and then is finally approved which I thought already happened its still actually not approved and can be rescinded at any waking moment for any undisclosed reason. This is utter XXXX.

Do you believe the agreement encloses a lender and a borrower? 

What do you believe the agreement is? 


Does this agreement show the words borrower, lender, loan, interest, money or credits within this agreement? 


According to your knowledge who was to loan to what to whom according to the written agreement? 

Do you believe an ordinary person can use ordinary terms and understand this written agreement? 

Do you believe you or your company legally own the promissory note and have the right to enforce payment from the borrower? 

Does a {$16000.00} note have actual cash value of {$16000.00}? Actual cash value mean the note can be sold for {$16000.00} in the ordinary course of business? 

So according to your understanding of the alleged agreement how much actual cash value must the bank loan to the borrower in order for the bank to legally fulfill the agreement and legally own the promissory note? 

So according to your belief if the borrower signs the promissory note and the bank refuses to loan the borrower {$16000.00} actual cash value would the bank or the borrower own the promissory note? The borrower Do you believe the borrower agreed to provide the bank with {$16000.00} Of actual value which was then used to fund the {$16000.00} bank loan check back to the same borrower and then agreed to pay the bank back {$16000.00} plus interest? 

So if this happened in your opinion would the bank legally own the promissory note and be able to force XXXX to pay the bank interest and principal payments? 

Well is it bank policy that when a borrower receives a {$16000.00} bank loan the bank receives {$16000.00} actual cash value from the borrower that this gives value to a {$16000.00} bank loan check and then this check is returned to the borrower as a bank loan which the borrower must pay? 

Is this normal policy? 

Do you believe the agreement between XXXX  and the bank is that I provide the bank with an actual cash value of {$16000.00} which is used to fund a {$16000.00} bank loan check back to myself which then am required to repay plus interest back to the same bank? 

Did you not say earlier an ordinary person can use ordinary terms and can understand this written agreement? 

Is there anything in this agreement showing that the borrower had knowledge or showing the borrower gave the bank permission or authorization for the bank to receive {$16000.00} In actual cash value from the borrower in the note and to use this to fund the {$16000.00} bank loan check which obligates the borrower to give the bank back {$16000.00} plus interest? 


If the borrower provided the bank with actual cash value of {$16000.00} in the note which the bank used to fund the {$16000.00} check and return the check back to the alleged borrower as a bank loan check in your opinion did Bank loan {$16000.00} to the borrower? 

So if a bank customer provides actual cash value of {$16000.00} to the bank and the banker returns {$16000.00} actual cash value back to the same customer is this a swap or exchange of {$16000.00} for {$16000.00}? 


Did the agreement call for an exchange or swap for {$16000.00} for another {$16000.00} or did it call for a {$16000.00} loan? 


Is LendBuzzs to follow the federal reserve bank policies and procedures when banks grant loans? 

What is the standard bank book keeping entries for granting loans according to the federal reserve bank policies and procedures and now Ill hand you the banker Fed Publication entitled XXXX XXXX XXXX by The Federal Reserve Bank XXXX XXXX Is this a swap or exchange of actual cash value? 

Does they not have both equal value? 

So if the banks deposits or liabilities increase do the banks assets increase by an asset that has actual cash value? 

Is there any exception? 

So if the banker records a new deposit, and records a asset out of the banks books having actual cash value would the actual cash value always come from a customer of the bank, investor, or a lender to the bank? 


Is the bank policy to record the promissory note as a bank asset offset by a new liability? 


Does the promissory note have actual cash value equal to the amount of the bank loan check? 


Then does this book keeping entry prove that the borrower provided actual cash value to fund the bank loan check? 


How much actual cash value did the bank loan to obtain the promissory note? 


Then how much actual cash value did the bank recieve from the borrower? 


So is it true you recieved {$16000.00} actual cash value from the borrower plus monthly payments and then repossessed the vehicle and you never invested XXXX  cent of legal tender or other depositors money to obtain the promissory note in the first place? 


Is it true the borrower financed the whole transaction? 


Are you telling me the borrower agreed to give the bank {$16000.00} actual cash value for free and the banker returned the actual cash value back to the borrower as a bank loan? 


Do the standard Fed publications show the bank receives actual cash value from the borrower for free and that the bank returns it back to the borrower as a bank loan? 


Do you believe the bank does this without the borrowers knowledge or written permission or authorization? 


To the best of your knowledge is there written permission or authorization for the bank to transfer actual cash value {$16000.00} from the borrower to the bank and for the bank to keep it for free? 

Does this allow the bank to use the {$16000.00} actual cash value to fund the {$16000.00} bank loan check back to the same borrower forcing the borrower to pay LENDBUZZ back plus interest? 


Then if the bank transferred {$16000.00} actual cash value from the borrower to the bank in this part of the transaction did the bank loan anything of value to the borrower? 


Is it the bank policy to first transfer the actual cash value from the alleged borrower to the lender for the amount of the alleged loan? 


Does the bank pay actual irs tax on the actual cash value transferred from the alleged borrower to the bank as income? 


If a loan is forgiven is it taxable? 


Is it the bank policy to not return the actual cash value that they recieved from the alleged borrower unless it is returned as a loan from the bank to the alleged borrower? 


You never payed taxes on the actual cash value you received from the alleged borrower and keep it as banks property? 


When a lender receives actual cash value from the alleged borrower does the bank claim that it then owns it and then its the property of the lender without the bank loaning or risking XXXX cent of legal tender or other depositors money? 


Are you telling me that banking policy is that the bank owns the promissory note which is the actual cash value without loaning once cent of other depositors money, or legal tender that the alleged borrower is the one who provided the funds deposited to fund the bank loan check and that the bank gets funds from the alleged borrower for free? 

Is the money then returned back to the same person as a loan which the alleged borrower repays when the bank never came up with any of its own money to obtain the promissory note? 


I gave you the equivalent of {$16000.00} you returned the funds back to me and I have to repay you {$16000.00} plus interest Does congress allow the banks to breach written agreements, use false and misleading advertising, act without written permission and authorization and without the alleged borrowers knowledge to transfer actual cash value from the alleged borrower to the bank and the return it back as a loan? 


Is it true that the actual cash value that was used to fund the bank loan check came directly from the borrower and that the bank received the funds from the alleged borrower for free? 


Is it the bank policy to transfer actual cash value from the alleged borrower to the bank and keep funds it as bank property which they then loan out as bank loans as if they actually own it and loaned their own money? 


Was it the banks intent to recieve actual cash value from the borrower and return the value of the funds back to the borrower as a loan? 


Do you believe that it was borrowers intent to fund his own bank loan check? 


So if a lender loaned a borrower {$10000.00} and the borrower refused to pay do you believe the lender is damaged? 


Is it the bank policy to take actual cash value from the borrower use it to fund the bank loan check and never return the actual cash value to the borrower? 


Was the actual cash value the bank received from the alleged borrower returned of the money the bank took or was it returned as a bank loan to the borrower? 


So how did the bank get the borrowers money for free?

05/14/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX United States The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Washington , DC XXXX XX/XX/year> WITHOUT PREJUDICE Subject : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to CFPB. 
Case Reference : XXXX Upon examining the response from BoA on XX/XX/year>, I have concluded that it is inadequate and unjust. 
The investigation process appears to be biased against me as the victim, and lacks knowledge of good industry practices and compassion towards me as a customer. 
Your response seems to be based on a flawed understanding of my situation, and crucial information that contradicts your position. The decision made in relation to the issue I raised did not consider my vulnerability as a victim of financial crime and BoA 's responsibility to protect its clients from such crimes. 
Financial institutions have a duty to conduct business with due skill, care, and diligence, and BoA 's subpar intervention in my case clearly falls short of reasonable business conduct. 
I am not looking for a debate about what could have been done, but rather a transparent, evidence-based investigation that considers my vulnerability, the sophistication of the scam, the shortcomings of XXXX to identify fraudulent companies, and BoA 's failure to identify suspicious transactions in a timely manner. 
When determining what is reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability and consider the following common queries : whether BoA neglected any rule, law, or regulation that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; whether they owed a fiduciary duty to me and breached it ; whether they promoted the questionable transaction despite being aware of its nature ; whether they were in compliance with their own policies and procedures ; whether they owed duties to me, the scope of those duties, and whether they failed to uphold them ; whether their conduct was unfair ; and whether they have the ability and should compensate me for the harm that has occurred. 
Furthermore, it is completely preposterous that Bank of America stated in their statement that they would be happy to provide me with a provisional credit for the transactions of {$6.00} and {$11.00}. If I had known about the risks, which Bank of America never informed me about, I never would have sent the money. 

Bank of America would have seen that this is a fraud if they had questioned me further at the time and asked how I had originally gotten in touch with this fraudster. 
These kinds of frauds, in my opinion, happen on a daily basis, and financial institutions are more aware than their clients that this might happen to them. 
I hope that you will take these key points into account to reach a fair outcome. 

BoA had sufficient information available to justify and had the capability of stopping these payments altogether, but chose not to. 
XXXX. Educate clients : Banks can provide educational resources to their clients to help them identify and avoid scams. 
This can include tips on how to recognize phishing emails, how to protect personal information, and how to avoid fraudulent investment schemes. 
XXXX. Implement security measures : Banks should have robust security measures in place, such as multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access to client accounts. They should also regularly monitor client accounts for any suspicious activity and notify clients immediately if any suspicious activity is detected. 
XXXX. Increase fraud detection : Banks should invest in advanced fraud detection systems to detect and prevent scams. This can include using artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify patterns of fraudulent activity. 
XXXX. Collaborate with law enforcement : Banks can work with law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute scammers. They can also share information about scams to help prevent future incidents. 
XXXX. Provide immediate assistance : In the event that a client falls victim to a scam, banks should provide immediate assistance to help mitigate the impact. This can include freezing accounts, cancelling transactions, and providing financial support to clients. 
Misplaced Accountability : Victims of scams are often limited in their ability to react, as they instinctively and immediately respond to the demands of the perpetrator. It can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to consciously refrain from such reactions. Giving off signals that make us vulnerable to these schemes is not the same as being grossly negligent, given the increasingly sophisticated nature of scams that are pervasive in society. 
In my case, personal circumstances made me particularly vulnerable during the victimization period, as I was financially illiterate and inexperienced in the finance sector. This made me a prime target for criminal enterprises in this field. Since then, I have gained a greater understanding of the scope and nature of these crimes and the operations of the financial services sector on an international level. 
Financial institutions are well aware of the risks posed by these crimes to their clients, who may have limited knowledge of these dangers. It is important to note that victims of scams are not individuals who have made poor investment decisions, but rather individuals who have been tricked, lied to, deceived, and emotionally manipulated. Sophisticated and aggressive sales techniques can trap unsuspecting victims who are unable to escape until most or all of their funds have been lost or stolen by the scammers. A good comparison is to a perpetrator who "" grooms '' their victim while also assaulting them and preventing them from escaping. 
The grounds upon which you refute my claim : Upon scrutiny, it is evident that your claims are flawed in attempting to thoroughly investigate the available facts, let alone provide an accurate portrayal of the role of Financial Institutions in fighting financial crime and fraud, your organization 's services, and other pertinent details regarding our relationship and its historical context. By focusing on inadequate due diligence checks, inconsequential references, and one-dimensional thinking, you present a distorted view of my fundamental rights as a customer, and offer a poor model for comprehending the issue in a well-reasoned and objective manner. 
This approach also serves as a deficient guide to determining whether any wrongdoing occurred on your part. 
Regarding the "" authorization '' argument, you argue that statements such as "" the transaction has been authorized '' and "" the duty of care has been breached '' are incompatible. However, you have not demonstrated that these statements are logically contradictory or improbable with regard to each other. 
They are not mutually exclusive when considered in the broader context. 
The view that my authorization of the transaction renders me fully liable oversimplifies the situation and overlooks other relevant factors related to the breach of duty of care. Clearly, there are additional facts that must be taken into account beyond what initially appears. 
Conclusion : Finally, as the foregoing analysis shows, BoAs grossly negligent failure to stop the fraud in question played a key role in causing my damages. BoA compounded such failures by making improper factual determinations and wrongfully rejecting the allegations made. BoAs failure to propose remedial action to achieve a just outcome in my case, as well as their ineffective assistance has resulted in my incurring staggering losses and runs contrary to their purported longstanding commitment to protecting the integrity and fairness of the market against any abuses. 
I formally request, in the name of justice as well as the points made above, that my case proceed with mediation/arbitration so that no party ends up suffering as a result of unjust actions and the refusal of anyone to take the basic responsibilities for enabling this to happen/doing nothing to set things right. 
The information provided should meet the criteria for these reconsiderations. 
If despite these objections, my concerns are not appropriately taken into consideration and are instead simply dismissed, you can be assured that alternative action will be taken, and I will make it a point to share our exchanges with the public so that at least pre-emptive action can be taken by other potential clients to avoid any dealings with organizations where customer security is not a priority. 
Thank you.

To be fair to everyone, including XXXX, Chase is guilty of this as well ; however, I will not lump these two incredibly different companies together, because Chase has shown a genuine eagerness to make this situation right. And we ( Chase, myself, and some others ) are currently working together on a solution that can hopefully benefit a lot of underserved individuals and steer this resolution in a positive direction. For this comment, I will leave my remarks to/about XXXX to a minimum. They dont deserve any more of my time. 

Those reading should know that XXXX falsely added XXXX worth of debt to my credit profile during the beginning of the COVID pandemic, which messed up my credit score and triggered a series of events that have almost rendered me homeless ( multiple times ) in the past three months and caused me a great deal of difficulty these past few months ( the understatement of the century ). They effectively nuked my credit score, refused to admit they did anything wrong, proceed to deny me performance-based credit that I earned ( using references to vague changes in my credit report - that I later found out they caused ), and then they effectively barred me from the means to liquidate my own assets by refusing to allow me to put my card on file to facilitate an ACH transfer, with the goal of liquidating of some spare assets, thereby preventing me from obtaining the capital that I needed to pay them and others ( and causing my credit score to fall even further ). 

They have gone out of their way to be difficult, uncooperative, and unresponsive. If I could feel anything for XXXX at this point ( because feeling something for them would imply I give a XXXX ), it would be deep disappointment. It is not my place to tell them ( or anyone ) how to feel ; however, if it were me, I would be ashamed. You ( I am directing this to you, XXXX ) are a waste of space, a waste of matter, a waste of atoms, a waste of subatomic particles, etc. ( or whatever you want to call it my point is that your existence is utterly useless and even nonconducive towards the long-term survival and success of the human race ). Although it is not up to me, if it were : your organization would simply cease to exist. And, to be clear to the ( assumedly ) smug executives at XXXX reviewing this comment : You will, at some point, as all maladaptive beings/traits ultimately do, cease to exist. I hope you all are ready for that day ; because, the way things are going, your organization 's time is soon. 

To anyone reading this comment, I am proud to say that I am still Chase 's customer ; and, as I expressed to XXXX  ( the JP Morgan/Chase Executive Director who has been so kind to me, and, as an extension, my loved ones, throughout this ordeal ), I plan to open a checking/savings account with the Chase in coming weeks, as soon as I am able to do so. 

I would like to add that opening a new bank account is a big deal for me. Even though I am 25+ miles away from the nearest XXXX  XXXX XXXX  location, I have continued to bank with them ( XXXX  XXXX ) here in California for 3+ years, because they have been good to me, and I feel comfortable with them. People tend to resist change, and I am no different. I have done my banking ( savings and checking ) pretty much exclusively through XXXX XXXX up until this point. And I will continue to keep my bank accounts with them ; because, they have been fair to me for the entirety of my stint as a customer, including the time leading-up-to and throughout this entire ordeal with XXXX. And I would like to express my gratitude to the team at XXXX XXXX for that. 

That stated ( and putting all, or, at least, most loyalties aside ), I need a bank that is convenient to me here in California for many reasons, and that is why I need to open another account. And Chase has my business. Simply put, business requires trust, and I trust Chase with my money and my business, because they listen to what I have to say and respect my boundaries. 

Despite some challenges along the way, thank you to the team/directors behind the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa for showing a genuine eagerness to listen and respond to my feedback constructively. I look forward to continuing to work together to strive for better for society. I also want to thank whoever has been reviewing these comments and forwarding to the various organizations involved - I acknowledge and appreciate your efforts. 

To those at Chase, please let me know if you all need help with the algorithms that govern your databases ( assuming you all have not already figured it out and made adjustments ). My XXXX XXXX is working on a project with XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the Department of Energy, and some others called the XXXX XXXX XXXX ; and, we are using machine learning algorithms to streamline and optimize process-based automation systems in real-time, effectively allowing machines to use live data streams to adapt and self-optimize ( in terms of improving operational functionality and safety ). 

These optimization processes ( the ones we currently use and the ones you would need to optimize your database ( s ) accordingly ) function on similar principles, as they both analyze live data with the goal of providing real-time feedback. Not to be redundant, however, if you all recall, the issue that I was having with Chase was that they shipped my credit card to the wrong address ( twice ). As of when I applied for the card ( I do not know if this is still happening ), I did not receive a warning or notification that Chase/Amazon were going to ship my card to a different address that the one in my application. 

My suggestion is for you all to modify your system to give users some type of a warning. This can be done in any number of ways. If security when cross-referencing your companies ' databases ( for privacy/legal reasons ) is an issue, you can use public key cryptography and symmetric encryption protocols to create and implement a secure end-to-end encryption. If thats possible, it is feasible to implement this system along with an added looping contingency designed to cross-reference transactional data from Amazon ( with respect to each sub-account considered separately from the main account holder ) with the application data that the customer is entering in real-time. The contingency ( in laymens terms ) simply put : "" If The # of Orders Made/Delivered to the specific address of a Sub-Account ( within a reasonable period of time, i.e. past 6 months ) is more than the amount of orders made/delivered to the main account holders address ( from that subaccount ), then trigger a warning. This warning can manifest itself as an in-browser notification ( symmetric encryption protocols are capable of functioning vis -- vis browsers ) that warns the customer in some capacity. For example, "" ( Customer Name ), it looks like the shipping address we have on file for the primary account holder is different than the address that we noticed the majority of your orders have been getting delivered to in the past six months. Would you like to ship the card to ( Insert Most Used Sub-Account Receiving Address ) instead? Yes, No, Ship to Other. '' Or something like that. 

Not only would this allow you all to set up a warning message for your customers when they are applying for the card, when incorporated with machine learning principles, one could also use the information/feedback provided ( vis -- vis activity tracking, etc ) to adjust and improve future automated responses to those customers ( i.e. instead of asking every time, the system will know, or at least have a good idea, of the customer intent based on former patterns ). 

If at any point it is needed, I would like to extend Chase the option to reach out to us for help in the future, and I will be more than happy to provide assistance if I can ( or to set up appointments/meetings/consultations with those in the research sector who may be able to provide assistance ). Not that such an organization needs my help - I almost feel foolish offering. However, I would like to emphasize the sincerity of my offer.

I am XXXX XXXX, an independent candidate for XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). This timing makes the closure appear politically motivated.

Under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq. ) and Regulation E ( 12 C.F.R. Part 1005 ), Cash App must investigate disputes, provide written results, and furnish documents relied upon. I demanded : ( 1 ) reopening or written legal justification, ( XXXX ) copies of investigative records, ( XXXX ) confirmation of fund status, and ( XXXX ) assurance of no negative reporting. 

Cash App has not complied. I seek immediate reopening, full documentation, confirmation of fund status, and compensation for losses caused by the lockout. 


-- - Expanded Narrative ( if form allows more detail or as PDF attachment ) Who I am : My name is XXXX XXXX, an independent candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives ( Michigans 9th District ).

What happened : Cash App ( Block, Inc. ) closed or disabled my account without providing any lawful or factual basis. I have repeatedly requested : Reopening or written legal justification citing policies/statutes ; Copies of all documents relied upon in the decision ( incident reports, flags, decision logs, internal notes ) ; Confirmation of the status of funds ; Written assurance of no adverse reporting. 


Cash App has ignored these requests. The timing of this closure during my candidacy raises serious concerns of politically motivated de-platforming.

Why this is unlawful : Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq. ) and Regulation E ( 12 C.F.R. Part 1005 ) require timely investigation of disputes, written notice of results, and access to documents relied upon. 

Cash Apps own policies echo these requirements.

Harm suffered : Loss of access to financial services during an active federal campaign ; Lost opportunities and reputational harm ; Delays in lawful transactions.

01/20/25,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"I am filing this complaint to warn this agency of the financial impact of this product that Ingo Money ( https : //ingomoney.com/ ). This check cashing application attempts to clear checks immediately upon submission of the check to the application. Some weeks, I used this service. Ingo Money uses XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. and XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide the banking services for the physical movement of its transactions. This complaint also focuses on these two banks as they are "" covered persons '' under rules of the CFPB. The first time I used the application I was successful. But, I attempted to use the application a second time. This was between the weeks of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Now, It was my understanding that the application would have verified the fund with the bank. I later found out that this is not the case. 

I submitted a picture of the check because my mother was having issues with submitting the check online with her phone that uses an XXXX based operating system. So on the date of XX/XX/XXXX, IngoMoney application was not servicing any clients with XXXX based phones, which alienated and every user with an XXXX based phone. This in itself presents a clear violation of the laws. The consumer protection laws ( CFPB ) make no distinction between banks and their agents. Based on this inability to service these customers, this application may have violated several laws relating to equity and fairness to US consumer protection laws in any state that the company has a NMLS license for. 

The second possible violation is simply that, this service guises itself as a check cashing app, when it in fact is predatory in nature. This application charges very high fees for it's services. As an example, I cashed a check for {$1500.00} and was charged a {$75.00} processing fee ( 4.98 % ). As explained earlier, Ingo does not verify the funds of the check. The application uses algorithms to "" predict '' or "" merely guessing '' the future collection of fund on the check. Consider the reasons below : Limitations of the Current Approach : Overreliance on Predictions : Models trained on historical data may fail to capture edge cases or new fraud techniques.

Predicting whether a check is valid without verifying funds introduces significant financial risk.

No Immediate Fund Verification : The absence of real-time bank verification to confirm account balances or check authenticity is a glaring gap. 
Predicted "" good '' checks might bounce later, leading to financial losses and trust issues. 

False Positives and Negatives : False Positives : Fraudulent checks may be cashed because they appear "" real '' based on past data patterns.

False Negatives : Legitimate checks might be flagged and rejected, leading to poor user experiences.

Limited Due Diligence : AI predictions don't replace actual financial checks like clearing processes or account verification. 
Reliance solely on predictions can result in lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, or reputational damage.

Now, a standard brick and mortar check cashing establishment operates during normal banking hours and has the necessary tools and mechanisms ( LAN line, mobile phone, fax, email, etc ) to immediately verify the funds on the check. By definition the brick and mortar check cashing establishment is a "" true '' check cashing apparatus and not Ingo Money. If IngoMoney can not verify the funds on the check which is the "" core '' feature of this service as it states in it's recorded message at ( XXXX ), It is "" falsely '' marketing itself as a check cashing service. This service is more aligned with pay-day lending over check cashing. The verification of funds "" must '' be completed, whether it be by human or a computing system. 

At present, IngoMoney does not do business in New York State. This could be due to the aggressive and misleading nature of this service. The company states that it is merely check verifier which is not the case. And if that is the case, then those fees should be absorb by it's banking partners mentioned earlier in this complaint and not directly by the customer. IngoMoney is offered across several alternative banking verticals ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and others ). It also offers it as a stand alone service, meaning that you do not have to use a partner and you can utilize the service by itself. But again, IngoMoney, is misrepresenting itself as a check verifier and check casher because the application is designed to make a "" guess '' or "" prediction '' based on the algorithms ability to determine whether the funds will clear on any check presented to the application.

There is a grave systemic risk posed by this application to consumers, banking partners and its alternative banking partners. XXXX has XXXX XXXX users. XXXX has XXXX XXXX users which would include XXXX, because XXXX is the parent company of XXXX. IngoMoney needs to cease its offering of this check cashing product, until it can clearly demonstrate to this agency that it is "" truly '' verifying every check with the originating issuer of the check and explain what it's exposure to risk it is currently experiencing, has experience and risk it XXXX experience in the future. 

This application has a "" wide blast radius '' based on the clients and partners that it contracts with. IngoMoney has to prove to this agency that it can contain any risk presented as a result of it's potential systemic risk to consumer, its banking partners and its alternative banking partners. Similar to the stress testing imposed by regulators during the global financial crisis in XXXX. 

Lastly, there is also potential that Ingo is providing an unfair market advantage ( monopoly ) that would allow other entrants to enter this market. My belief is that Ingo doesn't have alot of competition due in part to it's high risk and speculative business model.

To be fair to everyone, including Amex, XXXX is guilty of this as well ; however, I will not lump these two incredibly different companies together, because XXXX has shown a genuine eagerness to make this situation right. And we ( XXXX, myself, and some others ) are currently working together on a solution that can hopefully benefit a lot of underserved individuals and steer this resolution in a positive direction. For this comment, I will leave my remarks to/about Amex to a minimum. They dont deserve any more of my time. 

Those reading should know that Amex falsely added XXXX worth of debt to my credit profile during the beginning of the COVID pandemic, which messed up my credit score and triggered a series of events that have almost rendered me homeless ( multiple times ) in the past three months and caused me a great deal of difficulty these past few months ( the understatement of the century ). They effectively nuked my credit score, refused to admit they did anything wrong, proceed to deny me performance-based credit that I earned ( using references to vague changes in my credit report - that I later found out they caused ), and then they effectively barred me from the means to liquidate my own assets by refusing to allow me to put my card on file to facilitate an ACH transfer, with the goal of liquidating of some spare assets, thereby preventing me from obtaining the capital that I needed to pay them and others ( and causing my credit score to fall even further ). 

They have gone out of their way to be difficult, uncooperative, and unresponsive. If I could feel anything for Amex at this point ( because feeling something for them would imply I give a XXXX ), it would be deep disappointment. It is not my place to tell them ( or anyone ) how to feel ; however, if it were me, I would be ashamed. You ( I am directing this to you, Amex ) are a waste of space, a waste of matter, a waste of atoms, a waste of subatomic particles, etc. ( or whatever you want to call it my point is that your existence is utterly useless and even nonconducive towards the long-term survival and success of the human race ). Although it is not up to me, if it were : your organization would simply cease to exist. And, to be clear to the ( assumedly ) smug executives at Amex reviewing this comment : You will, at some point, as all maladaptive beings/traits ultimately do, cease to exist. I hope you all are ready for that day ; because, the way things are going, your organization 's time is soon. 

To anyone reading this comment, I am proud to say that I am still XXXX 's customer ; and, as I expressed to XXXX XXXX the XXXX XXXX Executive Director who has been so kind to me, and, as an extension, my loved ones, throughout this ordeal ), I plan to open a checking/savings account with the XXXX in coming weeks, as soon as I am able to do so. 

I would like to add that opening a new bank account is a big deal for me. Even though I am 25+ miles away from the nearest XXXX  XXXX XXXX  location, I have continued to bank with them ( XXXX  XXXX ) here in California for 3+ years, because they have been good to me, and I feel comfortable with them. People tend to resist change, and I am no different. I have done my banking ( savings and checking ) pretty much exclusively through XXXX XXXX up until this point. And I will continue to keep my bank accounts with them ; because, they have been fair to me for the entirety of my stint as a customer, including the time leading-up-to and throughout this entire ordeal with Amex. And I would like to express my gratitude to the team at XXXX XXXX for that. 

That stated ( and putting all, or, at least, most loyalties aside ), I need a bank that is convenient to me here in California for many reasons, and that is why I need to open another account. And XXXX has my business. Simply put, business requires trust, and I trust XXXX with my money and my business, because they listen to what I have to say and respect my boundaries. 

Despite some challenges along the way, thank you to the team/directors behind the XXXX XXXX XXXX  Visa for showing a genuine eagerness to listen and respond to my feedback constructively. I look forward to continuing to work together to strive for better for society. I also want to thank whoever has been reviewing these comments and forwarding to the various organizations involved - I acknowledge and appreciate your efforts. 

To those at XXXX, please let me know if you all need help with the algorithms that govern your databases ( assuming you all have not already figured it out and made adjustments ). My research group is working on a project with XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the Department of Energy, and some others called the XXXX XXXX XXXX ; and, we are using machine learning algorithms to streamline and optimize process-based automation systems in real-time, effectively allowing machines to use live data streams to adapt and self-optimize ( in terms of improving operational functionality and safety ). 

These optimization processes ( the ones we currently use and the ones you would need to optimize your database ( s ) accordingly ) function on similar principles, as they both analyze live data with the goal of providing real-time feedback. Not to be redundant, however, if you all recall, the issue that I was having with XXXX was that they shipped my credit card to the wrong address ( twice ). As of when I applied for the card ( I do not know if this is still happening ), I did not receive a warning or notification that XXXX/XXXX  were going to ship my card to a different address that the one in my application. 

My suggestion is for you all to modify your system to give users some type of a warning. This can be done in any number of ways. If security when cross-referencing your companies ' databases ( for privacy/legal reasons ) is an issue, you can use public key cryptography and symmetric encryption protocols to create and implement a secure end-to-end encryption. If thats possible, it is feasible to implement this system along with an added looping contingency designed to cross-reference transactional data from XXXX ( with respect to each sub-account considered separately from the main account holder ) with the application data that the customer is entering in real-time. The contingency ( in laymens terms ) simply put : "" If The # of Orders Made/Delivered to the specific address of a Sub-Account ( within a reasonable period of time, i.e. past 6 months ) is more than the amount of orders made/delivered to the main account holders address ( from that subaccount ), then trigger a warning. This warning can manifest itself as an in-browser notification ( symmetric encryption protocols are capable of functioning vis -- vis browsers ) that warns the customer in some capacity. For example, "" ( Customer Name XXXX, it looks like the shipping address we have on file for the primary account holder is different than the address that we noticed the majority of your orders have been getting delivered to in the past six months. Would you like to ship the card to ( Insert Most Used Sub-Account Receiving Address ) instead? Yes, No, Ship to Other. '' Or something like that. 

Not only would this allow you all to set up a warning message for your customers when they are applying for the card, when incorporated with machine learning principles, one could also use the information/feedback provided ( vis -- vis activity tracking, etc ) to adjust and improve future automated responses to those customers ( i.e. instead of asking every time, the system will know, or at least have a good idea, of the customer intent based on former patterns ). 

If at any point it is needed, I would like to extend XXXX the option to reach out to us for help in the future, and I will be more than happy to provide assistance if I can ( or to set up appointments/meetings/consultations with those in the research sector who may be able to provide assistance ). Not that such an organization needs my help - I almost feel foolish offering. However, I would like to emphasize the sincerity of my offer. And this offer is not meant to patronize or pressure ; however, I intend to leave it open as a gesture of trust, respect, and gratitude to you, your team, and the tremendous efforts you all have made at XXXX. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude, not only through my words, but through my actions. You can reach out to me at any time.

This is to complain against the Bank of America
URGENCY: HIGH IMPORTANCE: HIGH
[WITHOUT PREJUDICE]
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX.
 I would like to draw your attention to XXXX XXXX XXXX - I had sent my complaint letter to Bank of America, in which I clearly stated how this scam has affected me personally, psychologically and financially.
I am afraid I have had to go through so much ""bureaucracy"" thus far in order to catch their attention to my concerns. This really doesn't show their complaints department in a good light, to say the least; and certainly, does not contribute tomyoverall satisfaction and peace of mind. My complaint is against the bank that did not do its job properly (could not prevent/foreseen fraud and could not conduct a proper investigation) and not against the vulnerable customer who fell victim and lost all the savings due to the misconduct of the bank.
I feel very distressed and cheated, all because no one took action immediately and
practice their duty of care, therefore I only request what I believe to be rightfully mine, as all institutions were more than negligent in protecting my account and handling the complaints. I comprehensively provided explanations and proof to my claim, even so, Bank of America never acknowledge my complaint, therefore, I have approached you CFPB and I would like to receive your assistance on this matter.
General Obligation:
Commencing on or around XXXX XXXX XXXX I fell victim to two multi-layered scam operations run by hackers which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX XXXX from my Bank of America account to fraudulent investment firms.
When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability; common queries include, but are not limited to, the following (i) whether Bank of America did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety; (ii) whether by virtue of Bank of Americas custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached; (iii) whether Bank of America promoted the transaction(s) in question despite being aware of the
 
nature of the transaction(s) in question (iv) whether Bank of America was in compliance with its own policies and procedures; (v) whether Bank of America owed duties to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether Bank of America did not uphold those duties; (vi) whether Bank of Americas conduct was unfair; and (vii) whether Bank of America has within its power the ability to, and should, compensate me for the harm that has befallen me.
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant criteria of fraud.
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and skill of a diligent, prudent banker. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not turn a blind eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In other words, Bank of America must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have known that I was dealing with a scammer.
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective element.
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of the evidence suggests that Bank of America did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious dangers in this respect.
Situations do tend to repeat themselves and it is advisable to examine previous outcomes to see how the standard of the reasonable person should be applied, and that lessons can be learnt from the errors of the past.
Apropos of the fluidity of the concept of reasonableness, all Bank of America has done in this regard is set up a dichotomy of having or not having the legal obligation under consideration, however, that does not go one-inch toward explaining why various regulatory authorities, has maintained that financial institutions can, and should, protect consumers using their systems, advanced technologies, and rich experience.
Bank of America is obliged to take some action if it is sufficiently aware of a real possibility that a fraud may be being perpetuated. If you don't question its customers instructions or raise the possibility of a scam with the customer in these circumstances, it may be liable if the red flags indicate the customer is:
 particularly vulnerable, or

 if the possibility of fraud was serious or real, not just suspected.
There are some recommendations to organisations for protecting customers from financial harm that might occur as a result of fraud or financial abuse; and gives guidance on how to recognise customers who might be at risk, how to assess the potential risks to the individual and how to take the necessary actions to prevent or minimise financial harm.
These recommendations are established as a general principle, the organisation should deliver a service that:
1) Takes a proactive approach to minimising risks, impact and incidences of financial harm and it sets out systems and tools for the prevention and detection of fraud and financial abuse. As a general point, it says organisations should ensure that all systems are developed using technologies and methodologies that are effective in the prevention of fraud and financial abuse, through authorised and unauthorised payments, thereby minimising the risk of financial harm to customers. As regards to the detection of fraud and financial abuse, it says the organisation:
A) should have measures in place across all payment channels and products to detect suspicious transactions or activities that might indicate fraud or financial abuse. It then lists the following examples of suspicious activity on customer accounts:
a. multiple cheque books;
b. sudden increased spending;
c. transfers to other accounts;
d. multiple password attempts;
e. logins from new devices, multiple geographical locations;
f. sudden changes to the operation of the account; Unusual transactions are transactions whose amount, characteristics and frequency bear no relation to the economic activity of the customer, exceed normal market parameters or have no apparent legal justification.
g. a withdrawal or payment for a large amount;
h. a payment or series of payments to a new payee;
i. financial activity that matches a known method of fraud or financial abuse.
B) organisations should have a process in place to ensure that staff make contact with the customer to verify the financial activity, challenge its authenticity, explain the nature of the suspected or detected fraud and discuss an appropriate plan of action.
I am deeply convinced that the disastrous results that I have previously elaborated upon will continue to ensue if no responsibility is adopted by Bank of America in relation to this matter. I have also thoroughly detailed why they cannot simply dismiss this problem by strictly adhering to legal technicalities which, after careful reflection, struck me as being nothing more than self-
  
interest. Indeed, it seems to me utterly unfair to disregard fragile, sensitive, and vulnerable consumers who are afflicted by such allegedly malevolent acts, thereby keeping an unjust status-quo that is corrupting our society at its core.
Conclusion:
Based on my analysis, and as confirmed by various authorities concerned with such matters, there is abundant evidence that forward-thinking financial institutions ought to take reasonable steps to forestall fraud, or at least mitigate its risk by using an effective risk management system, demonstrating their undisputed ability to responsibly and pre-emptively respond to questionable transactions in the digital arena. The use of such systems, largely based on newly
 
adopted technologies aimed at effectively navigating the evolving threat landscape, is only one of a number of possible endeavours undertaken in this connection, alongside the application of past knowledge and experience related to popular fraudulent practices.
Bank of Americas non-observance of the fundamental principles of justice  that is, to completely overlook and not even remotely try to mitigate the suffering of vulnerable consumers is inexcusable given the size of the establishment and the vast resources at its disposal as the direct result of the patronage of clients like myself.
In summary, I respectively ask your organisation to consider my points, given your personal and companywide obligation to provide a fair and reasonable investigation into the complaint.
I look forward to your input and would gladly cooperate to reach a fair and reasonable outcome. Thank you.

XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  Re: Demand Letter
Attn: Claims/Fraud Dept.
Dear Sir/Madam,
For negotiation purposes only, without effect as to any and all rights
  The goal of this letter is twofold: first, it aims to establish that a duty of care was breached, inasmuch as you have failed to perform adequate due diligence or/and not acted in a reasonable and prudent manner to prevent foreseeable substantial damages I suffered as a result of a fraud [ 1]. Second, it shall serve as formal written demand for reimbursement based on the aforementioned grounds, among others.
A very comprehensive analysis of fraud prevention suggests that by processing atypical, non-routine transactions, and/or by being aware of other fraudulent schemes similar to the one alleged herein and/or ignorance of obvious warning signs of fraud, you engaged in/ is a pattern or a practice of a wrongful and negligent conduct which provided substantial assistance to advance the commission of a fraud that resulted in my financial and psychological damages. The facts and details concerning the actions in question are set forth hereunder.
OVERVIEW
 Commencing on or about XXXX XXXX XXXX, I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated Hackers (the Scammer), all of which aim at contributing to the goal of robbing and defrauding innocent people.
 Money was transferred from my account via debit card, and through an intermediary named XXXX  in the
total amount of XXXX XXXX utilizing your services.
 This letter shall thrust into the spotlight, inter alia, the increasingly important role financial institutions play in
the fight against financial crime and fraud, and the pressing need for higher levels of supervision and vigilance
within your organization.
 Additionally, it is vital that you will immediately take all actions within your power to remedy the situation,
whether by raising chargeback in respect of the transactions in question or reimburse me and credit my account, for the full amount of these payments, in the total amount of XXXX XXXX
1 FCA: A more effective approach to combatting financial crime XXXX XXXX XXXX 1
   
Page 2 of 7 XXXX XXXX XXXX   Heres an indisputable fact: had you looked at the wider circumstances surrounding the above-referenced transactions, this illicit transfer of wealth could have been prevented.
 Executing transactions without proper authority is not only a severe regulatory offense but also an irresponsible and reckless disregard of the customers financial safety.
 Against this background, and without derogating any of my rights, I hereby hold you liable for financial and emotional harm as well as medical problems relating to this victimization and demand that you reimburse my account in full within 10 days from the date of this letter.
INTRODUCTION
Financial crimes and fraud investigations often involve a high degree of sophistication, complexity, and sensitiveness to detail. Accordingly, this letter aims to address the issue at hand as profoundly and fairly as possible, by taking into consideration contextual regulations, laws, and bylaws, as well as guidance, standards and rules promoted by supervisory authorities, relevant codes of practice and (where suitable) what was good industry practice (GIP) at all times relevant hereto. The allegations contained herein are predicated either upon knowledge with respect to myself and my own experience, or upon facts obtained through investigations conducted by qualified third parties. I strongly believe that substantive evidence in support of the allegations set forth herein will be found after an appropriate opportunity for discovery. Key facts supporting the allegations contained herein are known only to the Scammer or/and are exclusively within their control.
I did not know, and through the exercise of reasonable diligence could not have discovered, the fraud that was being perpetrated upon myself by the Scammer. Fraud is commonly conceptualized as withholding from the weaker party in a financial transaction information which is necessary to make an informed, rational or autonomous decision.
In this regard, even access to adequate information is insufficient to achieve complete autonomy. A complication here is that the weaker party might have trouble analyzing the data at hand sufficiently well to identify fraudulent schemes. A reasonable solution is that financial institutions would be required to promote transparent communication in which they track the understanding of its customers.
The false representations and omissions made by the Scammer have a tendency or capacity to deceive victims, such as myself, into unwittingly providing funds that fueled the Scammers fraudulent scheme and therefore are, by their very nature immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, and substantially injurious to consumersall at once.
As a result of the Scammers deceptive practices, I was deceived into transferring my funds to them. The false statements of material facts and omissions as described above; and the sham transactions the Scammer perpetrated upon myself; were unfair, unconscionable, and deceptive practices perpetrated on me which would have likely tricked a reasonable person under the circumstances.

 Please take notice that my funds were transferred through means of coercion and under false pretenses all along! Attached, please find supportive statements, screenshots, and further evidence.
EXPOSING YOUR ORGANIZATIONS MISCONDUCT
I hereby allege that your organization had breached the duty of care that is owed by a financial institution to its clients in circumstances where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the sole purpose of a payment instruction is to defraud the client. Under such circumstances, you are obliged to refrain from executing the payment instruction until you have been able to satisfy yourself that there is a legitimate basis for the instruction. Once the duty is engaged, the duty takes priority over the usual obligation on a financial institution to execute customer instructions promptly. The duty in question is often referred to as the Quincecare duty, because it was established in the case of Barclays Bank plc v Quincecare Ltd. (the Quincecare duty)
The Quincecare duty is well-established and requires financial institutions to take reasonable care and skill when executing clients instructions. It is recognized as authoritative by leading academic texts [2]. The duty arises in cases where it can be argued that an ordinary prudent staff member of a financial institution would have a reasonable basis for suspicion that a particular payment instruction would result in the misappropriation of the clients funds.
When the duty does arise, it can be discharged simply by refraining from executing the instruction unless and until such time as the financial institution has been able to establish that the instruction relates to a lawful obligation. The financial institution shall seek further information or/and documentation from the client in order to help establish this.
Based on the above, and after conducting a comprehensive review of our communication/interactions, it became glaringly obvious to me that no adequate information or/and documentation were sought by your organization, at best, and at worst no appropriate safeguards were implemented at all.
If a bank executed a customers order to transfer money knowing it to be dishonestly given, shutting its eyes to the obvious fact of the dishonesty or acting recklessly in failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make, it would be in breach of its duty of care, even if the payment was made in accordance with the terms of the mandate and the bank shall be liable to its client for damages in negligence.
Compliance departments should ensure that staff understand the legal requirements and that where there are suspicions, these suspicions must be communicated to all relevant personnel whilst they are investigated.

For the avoidance of doubt, reasonable grounds shall not necessarily be interpreted as proof. On the basis of various signs, you should have assumed that something fishy was going on and suspended transactions until you had made reasonable enquiries to satisfy yourself that the transactions was/were properly to be executed. In other words, I have been a victim of your negligence for facilitating the misappropriation of funds, and doing little to safeguard my financial interests. Any reasonable banker would have realized that there were many obvious, even glaring, signs that I was a fraud victim (Singularis Holdings Limited (in liquidation) v Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited [XXXX] UKSC 50) [ 3].
A financial institution which wrongly pays money away when it has no authority to do so will usually be treated as if it had paid using its own funds, not those of its customer. The debits made to my account should be reversed out, and damages to compensate me for any reasonably foreseeable losses incurred as a result of your failure to state the balance of my account accurately and properly. It is also libelous/defamatory to make false statements about someone that adversely affect their credit rating.
When discussing the responsibilities that a bank might incur, it is crucial not to forget the fact that a legitimate complaint by, or cause of action on the part of, a client might generate/give rise to further statutory cause of action or/and additional responsibilities or liabilities owed by a financial institution to the relevant regulatory authority. Obligations/duties owed by a bank to a regulator are distinct from those owed to the customer. On top of that, please remember you may owe liabilities to more than one regulator.
More often than not, such legal duties spring from the very facts that gave rise to the liabilities to your clients in the first place. Similarly to the foregoing, I may also have a cause of action against you for breach of mandate as you have negligently transferred my funds without proper authorization or enquiry.
Instead, you should have been working hard with Artificial Intelligence [4] / Big data technologies to discover automated and effective ways not only to detect fraud but also to prevent it. Furthermore, the tremendous amount of data you possess is by no means self-evident let alone to be overlooked, hence by not utilizing it systematically and effectively to pinpoint irregular and suspicious activities you are misleading your customers, who have taken the leap of faith and placed trust and confidence in your honesty, authority, and competence.
A plausible assumption here would be that the pattern of the above-mentioned transactions was sufficiently suspicious that it should have been flagged and blocked by your staff, even if you have never encountered similar situations.
According to the FCA [5]: XXXXXXXX  could do more to identify fraudulent incoming payments and prevent accounts from being compromised by fraudsters. XXXX fraud is where a fraudster tricks a payer into making an XXXX  to an account controlled by that fraudster under false pretenses, similarly to the above-described victimization.

Moreover, I argue that you should also make a reasonable estimate on the basis of relevant historical data of my account.
""Given XXXX fraud is currently a XXXX million problem and growing, the potential exposure for banks is very large indeed. This is yet another reason why the banking industry must do all it can to use the data available to it to detect and stop fraud.""
Practically speaking, effective steps to prevent bad actors from taking advantage of future victims (or at least to minimize this possibility) are abundant:
 The use of automated and human review of irregular or suspicious transactions and traffic patterns to identify financial crimes in general and common fraudulent schemes in specific;
 Human review of complaints from the public and law enforcement in connection with rapidly-growing, recurring, and popular fraudulent practices as well as suspicious merchants, including creating special channels for such complaints;
 Cross-checking warnings, notices, cautionary announcements, and reports concerning beneficiaries, merchants, associations, or countries often suspected to be associated with cyber-fraud from governments, central banks, regulatory bodies, law enforcement agencies, and watchdogs.
 Artificial Intelligence & XXXX embrace and leverage Machine Learning technologies and Big Data Analytics to identify fraudulent, or potentially fraudulent merchants by scrutinizing publications and reports about such merchants in the digital sphere (e.g. on forums, social media, et cetera.)
 Establishing contact with the recipient institution of fraud victims: any holds in place on new related activities, or similar blockers that prevent rapid rebranding of related/similar merchants.
It would also be wise to consider implementing additional safeguards where the movement of large sums of monies are concerned. For instance, you could specify additional prerequisites for executing the transfer of large sums such as: (1) requiring multiple levels of approval; (2) requesting more information concerning the intended purpose of the transfers and cross-checking for similar patterns of transfer; and (3) checking on my capacity to make such transfers. While such measures entail additional compliance costs, it would be sensible for you to err on the side of caution.

To: Bank of America
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  Subject: XXXX XXXX XXXX  complain to Bank of America
FAO: Bank of Americas complaints dept.
Dear Sir / Madam,
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
 This is my subsequent letter pursuant to the original, unanswered disputed letter sent to Bank of America on the XXXX XXXX XXXX
With this letter, I hereby express my utmost dissatisfaction with your lack of reply to the above referenced letter and reiterate key points that were raised and left unanswered previously supporting my request for your cooperation.
As I mentioned I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by hackers (the Company) and innocently lost XXXX XXXX  of my hard-earned life-savings due to your misadministration.
This complex issue has caused substantial harm to me, and if not appropriately addressed, will cause substantial harm to others, we must therefore conduct an in-depth and comprehensive review of all of the contributing factors that have led to an outcome as horrendous as the one described herein.
Due to personal circumstances, I was particularly vulnerable during the victimization period; I was also relatively financially illiterate and very inexperienced in the finance sector which made me a prime target for criminal enterprises in this field.
Financial institutions are well aware of the scope and nature of such crimes and the risks that these pose to their clients, who, in contrast, mostly have limited knowledge of these dangers.
To be clear, people who have been scammed such as myself, are not individuals who have made poor investment decisions. They are people who have been tricked, lied to, deceived and emotionally manipulated. Sophisticated, aggressive sales techniques end up trapping the uninformed and unsuspecting victim who once in the clutches of the scammer cannot get out until most or all of the funds have been lost (stolen) by the scammers. A good comparison is a XXXX who XXXX  his victim whilst at the same time XXXX XXXX  and prevents them from escaping.
Based on my analysis, and as confirmed by various authorities concerned with such matters, there is abundant evidence that forward-thinking financial institutions ought to take reasonable steps to forestall fraud, or at least mitigate its risk by using an effective risk management

system, demonstrating their undisputed ability to responsibly and preemptively respond to questionable transactions in the digital arena. The use of such systems, largely based on newly adopted technologies aimed at effectively navigating the evolving threat landscape, is only one of a number of possible endeavors undertaken in this connection, alongside the application of past knowledge and experience related to popular fraudulent practices.
What can Bank of America do?
Please be noted that I will not in any way quietly tolerate the consequences of your actions (or more precisely, the lack thereof). It is perfectly obvious that you could have, and should have, utilized various risk-based examination procedures and techniques, all of which are within your purview and could have entirely prevented this disastrous outcome.
As previously advised, you should have known, suspected, or had reason to suspect that the transactions (or pattern of transactions):
 involve funds the ultimate purpose of which was to fuel an illegal enterprise;
 is intended to disguise funds the ultimate purpose of which was to fuel an illegal
enterprise, in an attempt to avoid and thus violate regulations;
 is intentionally designed to defraud your customer;
 serves no legitimate or lawful purpose; and
 involve the use of your services to facilitate criminal activity.
There are so many other ways in which measures related to fraud prevention and mitigation could have been useful. Further factors that should have been taken into consideration include, but are not limited to, the following:
 The timing, volume, frequency, and nature of the transactions in question;
 The abnormality of such transactions against the background of your experience with me
as a customer and other entities associated with the transactions (if any);
 The suspicious nature of such transactions based on my overall risk profile including
vulnerability and identification and research of high-risk services/products;
 Systemic filtering mechanisms, whether manual or automatic, for the identification of
unusual activities; and
 Periodic evaluation of the usefulness, appropriateness and effectiveness of anti-fraud
programs, and other associated policies and procedures.
Relevant industry practices at the time of the victimisation:
Your Organization is obliged to take some action if it is sufficiently aware of a real possibility that a fraud may be being perpetuated. If you don't question its customers instructions or raise the possibility of a scam with the customer in these circumstances, it may be liable if the red flags indicate the customer is:
 particularly vulnerable, or
 if the possibility of fraud was serious or real, not just suspected.

Kind regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Download Affirm app YOU ( VIA THE HELP CENTER ) XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX Hello XXXX XXXX I spoke with representatives at XXXX and XXXX and both report that there is no security freeze on my file, temporary or permanent. So that was not the specific reason for the declination. Discrimination happened, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act make discrimination in a credit transaction unlawful.

ECOA makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, age ( provided the applicant has the capacity to contract ), because all or part of the applicants income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. I exercised my rights when I spoke with the Affirm representative last night. Take a listen to the multiple recorded phone calls. Once I started to exercise my rights in good faith, the phone calls were disconnected numerous times in an attempt to deny my rights as a consumer.

This Act ( Title VII of the Consumer Credit Protection Act ) prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of public assistance, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Act also requires creditors to provide applicants, upon request, with the reasons underlying decisions to deny credit.

In addition, ECOA provides that a creditor must provide a statement of specific reasons in writing to applicants against whom adverse action is taken. No specific reason was given, only a list of factors, which is different from a principal reason. Adverse action [ s ] include denying an application for credit, terminating an existing credit account, making unfavorable changes to the terms of an existing account, and refusing to increase a credit limit.

Pursuant to Regulation B, a statement of reasons for adverse action taken must be specific and indicate the principal reason ( s ) for the adverse action.> Regulation B explains that [ s ] tatements that the adverse action was based on the creditors internal standards or policies or that the applicant, joint applicant, or similar party failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditors credit scoring system are insufficient. The Official Interpretations to Regulation B explain that [ t ] he specific reasons disclosed... must relate to and accurately describe the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor. Moreover, [ i ] f the reasons listed on the forms are not the factors actually used, a creditor will not satisfy the notice requirement by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed. With respect to adverse actions based on a credit scoring system specifically, the Official Interpretations explain that the reasons disclosed must relate only to those factors actually scored in the system. Moreover, no factor that was a principal reason for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure. The creditor must disclose the actual reasons for denial ( for example, age of automobile ) even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.

I study consumer law and I am aware how borrowing, lending, banking, performance, securitization, and contracts work. Once I gave my Social Security Number and gave value to the credit application security, I should have been granted credit in the amount requested as a U.S. Citizen backed by the full faith and credit of the united states. This was more than sufficient to cover amount of the consumer credit transaction, which was the purchase price of the transaction {$660.00} on the XXXX website.

Grant the credit in an amount at or above the amount requested or retract my application security instrument and return the tender of the funds you received, to me. 
Thank you for your time and attention. 

By : *Name YOU ( VIA THE HELP CENTER ) XXXX, XXXX AM How is this case "" Closed ''? I have not received a response since informing XXXX that there are no security freezes at the listed credit reporting companies. 
XXXX AT AFFIRMXXXX, XXXX AM Hi *Name, My name is XXXX and I'm a supervisor on the Customer Care team with Affirm XXXX I understand you are seeking clarification regarding your recent loan declination. I'm happy to provide additional insight. 



When reviewing your application Affirm considers several factors on your credit report including things like recently opened and closed tradelines, your repayment history, your credit limit and usage rate as well as your inquiry history. I see your recent declinations between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were declined because your reported XXXX score is below our minimum requirement. The last time you were declined a loan with Affirm due to a security freeze was on XX/XX/XXXX. As a reminder, these denials do not mean you will never be approved for a loan with Affirm in the future. I can see from your account you have been approved for loans with Affirm in the past and are still able to apply for loans with us in the future. 



Additionally, please understand that Affirm does not discriminate against any prohibited factors, such as race, color, religion, marital status, national origin, age, gender or sex play a part in Affirm 's automated algorithm that determines the creditworthiness of our applicants.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact us through the Affirm Help Center at XXXX XXXX XXXX or call us at XXXX between the hours of XXXX am and XXXX pm XXXX  XXXX days a week. 



Thanks, XXXX XXXX. 

Download Affirm app YOU ( VIA THE HELP CENTER ) XXXX, XXXX PM As I stated prior, I study consumer law and I am aware how borrowing, lending, banking, performance, securitization, and contracts work. Once I gave my Social Security Number and gave value to the credit application security, I should have been granted credit in the amount requested as a XXXX Citizen backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. This was more than sufficient to cover amount of the consumer credit transaction, which was the purchase price of the transaction {$660.00} on the XXXX website. 
My multiple applications were turned into securities once I performed by offering my Social Security XXXXmber and a digital signature. Therefore either retract the multiple applications as instruments which were securitized and turned into legal tender at the time of the application and received by Affirm ; then tender payment to me for all interest, credits, and deposits received. Or grant the credit on an Affirm card in the amount of the transaction for each application instrument and return the tender of the funds you received, to the Principal from whom banks actually derive loan funds from. 

Thank you for your time and attention. 
By : *Name YOU ( VIA THE HELP CENTER ) XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX Hello XXXX XXXX, I read your reply. 

In it you state, "" I see your recent declinations between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were declined because your reported XXXX score is below our minimum requirement. '' That answer in insufficient and not a lawful reason. Once again Affirm is discriminating. 

As I listed in previous communication, Regulation B explains that [ s ] tatements that the adverse action was based on the creditors internal standards or policies or that the applicant, joint applicant, or similar party failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditors credit scoring system are insufficient.

So that answer about a score is insufficient.

Also, you stated, "" Additionally, please understand that Affirm does not discriminate against any prohibited factors, such as race, color, religion, marital status, national origin, age, gender or sex play a part in Affirm 's automated algorithm that determines the creditworthiness of our applicants. '' An automated algorithm is not sufficient as well.

Also in the law, "" Creditors who use complex algorithms, including artificial intelligence or machine learning, in any aspect of their credit decisions must still provide a notice that discloses the specific principal reasons for taking an adverse action. Whether a creditor is using a sophisticated machine learning algorithm or more conventional methods to evaluate an application, the legal requirement is the same : Creditors must be able to provide applicants against whom adverse action is taken with an accurate statement of reasons.15 The statement of reasons must be specific and indicate the principal reason ( s ) for the adverse action.16 A creditor can not justify noncompliance with ECOA and Regulation Bs requirements based on the mere fact that the technology it employs to evaluate applications is too complicated or opaque to understand. A creditors lack of understanding of its own methods is therefore not a cognizable defense against liability for violating ECOA and Regulation Bs requirements.

So yet and still, no specific and accurate reason given has been sufficient enough to justify the adverse action as anything but discrimination. Which is unlawful and a violation of the ECOA.

Yes. ECOA and Regulation B require creditors to provide statements of specific reasons to applicants against whom adverse action is taken. Some creditors may make credit decisions based on certain complex algorithms, sometimes referred to as uninterpretable or black-box models, that make it difficultif not impossibleto accurately identify the specific reasons for denying credit or taking other adverse actions.1 The adverse action notice requirements of ECOA and Regulation B, however, apply equally to all credit decisions, regardless of the technology used to make them. Thus, ECOA and Regulation B do not permit creditors to use complex algorithms when doing so means they can not provide the specific and accurate reasons for adverse actions.

ECOA makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, age ( provided the applicant has the capacity to contract ), because all or part of the applicants income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.2 In addition, ECOA provides that a creditor must provide a statement of specific reasons in writing to applicants against whom adverse action is taken.3 Adverse action [ s ] include denying an application for credit, terminating an existing credit account, making unfavorable changes to the terms of an existing account, and refusing to increase a credit limit.4 Pursuant to Regulation B, a statement of reasons for adverse action taken must be specific and indicate the principal reason ( s ) for the adverse action.>5 Regulation B explains that [ s ] tatements that the adverse action was based on the creditors internal standards or policies or that the applicant, joint applicant, or similar party failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditors credit scoring system are insufficient.6 The Official Interpretations to Regulation B explain that [ t ] he specific reasons disclosed... must relate to and accurately describe the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor.7 Moreover, while Appendix C of Regulation B includes sample forms intended for use in notifying an applicant that adverse action has been taken, [ i ] f the reasons listed on the forms are not the factors actually used, a creditor will not satisfy the notice requirement by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed.8 With respect to adverse actions based on a credit scoring system specifically, the Official Interpretations explain that the reasons disclosed must relate only to those factors actually scored in the system. Moreover, no factor that was a principal reason for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure. The creditor must disclose the actual reasons for denial ( for example, age of automobile ) even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.9 ECOAs notice requirements were designed to fulfill the twin goals of consumer protection and education.10 In terms of consumer protection, the notice requirement is intended to prevent discrimination ex ante because if creditors know they must explain their decisions... they [ will ] effectively be discouraged from discriminatory practices.11 The notice requirement fulfills a broader need as well by educating consumers about the reasons for the creditors action.12 As a result of being informed of the specific reasons for the adverse action, consumers can take steps to try to improve their credit status or, in cases where the creditor may have acted on misinformation or inadequate information [, ]... to rectify the mistake.13 In addition, Congress also believed ECOAs notice requirement would have a beneficial competitive effect on the credit marketplace.14 Creditors who use complex algorithms, including artificial intelligence or machine learning, in any aspect of their credit decisions must still provide a notice that discloses the specific principal reasons for taking an adverse action. Whether a creditor is using a sophisticated machine learning algorithm or more conventional methods to evaluate an application, the legal requirement is the same : Creditors must be able to provide applicants against whom adverse action is taken with an accurate statement of reasons.15 The statement of reasons must be specific and indicate the principal reason ( s ) for the adverse action.16 A creditor can not justify noncompliance with ECOA and Regulation Bs requirements based on the mere fact that the technology it employs to evaluate applications is too complicated or opaque to understand. A creditors lack of understanding of its own methods is therefore not a cognizable defense against liability for violating ECOA and Regulation Bs requirements.

So stop discriminating against the Principal and grant the amount of credit on each application instrument that was securitized and turned into tender for payment. Once you were given a Social Security Number and a digital signature performance and tender were completed.

Or you can retract each one of those application instruments and tender payment to the Principal for all interest, credits, deposits, payment, or legal tender Affirmed received and tender all interest, credits, deposits, payment, or legal tender and mail to the Principal.

As I stated prior, I study consumer law and I am aware how borrowing, lending, banking, performance, securitization, and contracts work. I know that credit is not created until performance a of a security instrument such as an application. Banks can't lend from there own deposits so immediately upon submission of the application, a credit and deposit ledger entry is created.

Under the Consumer Protection Act I am exercising my rights in good faith as a Consumer and U.S. Citizen backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. You would not deny an application security instrument submitted by the United States, don't deny my multiple applications, that are backed by the United States.

Stop discriminating and add an Affirm card to the account in the amount of all the values of each application instruments performance.

However, the second was not to my knowledge. I believe it was used to track me by groups involved in proxy investigations and ultimately by groups of people who are employed by JP Morgan involved in essentially in an occupation which is designed to target me, attempt to corrode me personally while stealing commercial projects and ip. Some of this may extend to copyright XXXX which as the idea evolved I would like to be an extended show on XXXX with a number of peripheral endeavors like a making of/documentary, retail, magazine, photography, label, art, photography, marketing, soundtrack, books, broadcast live event, licensing, partnerships and material as well as any rights down the line all incorporated and structured within a company - or whatever is the best possible solution and integrating new technologies to improve all processes associated and opening the door to research and experimentation such as with blockchain and AI/machine learning. However, XXXX began developing a set of ediscovery standards that actually began after these matters and is currently in the process of updating and implementing more for example standards XXXX and XXXX. I inputted my account numbers into this process, XXXX and also prior to this XXXX. Due to unusual security issues I think it could be better to disclose when I have that. Unfortunately, I was violated during a medical procedure but interestingly implanted with a cortical modem I believe. Some of the ediscovery process could interact. I obviously was not aware of this aspect of the procedure but I do believe groups involved have attempted to use whatever means they could to procure elevated security access to frame me to maintain it. Hence anything associated with those accounts or purchases made. However, I believe those at JP Morgan the actual bank could be apart of the groups involved attempting to finance a takeover of my projects and relying on their access here to access other bills. They are doing this while I believe they know I am entitled to money and payment and instead are blocking and lying about this while attempting to prolong a situation. Some of those involved are connected to XXXX XXXX. For example, I recently named XXXX XXXX who is a former acquaintance from XXXX XXXX, and I think could be someone using those loans or at the Department of ED to attempt to delay and deny me clarity and resolve. Other things like XXXX and XXXX where there were proxy investigation such as osta gain etc could be pathways to justify also. For example, cases that linked to my email accounts were iron magazine and then osta gain and spectrum peptides handled by ICE, FDA, USDOJ, XXXX. Or tracking visits to places abroad such as XXXX saunas XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX in XXXX. However, the prevailing focus I believe was XXXX XXXX.

04/01/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I have recently received correspondence from American Express Customer Advocate Services Team regarding a recent complaint lodged with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). In the communication, it was asserted that American Express is incapable of retracting my application due to its submission status. However, it is imperative to clarify that this assertion is incorrect. The true reason for American Express 's inability to retract my application lies in the fact that it has already been transmitted in accordance with the Electronic Transfer Act, subsequently transformed into a receivable, and deposited, as explicitly detailed in my previous correspondence. Attached herewith is the transaction history from American Express, delineating the precise movement of funds. Moreover, it is concerning that American Express purports to be "" committed to treating all customers fairly '' and its representatives pledge to "" adhere to all laws and regulations '' while simultaneously engaging in actions that directly contravene this commitment. It is evident that American Express 's actions are in blatant violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1691 ) and a host of other statutory provisions. Allow me to elucidate the specific legal infractions perpetrated by American Express in denying my entitlement to unlimited consumer credit. It is imperative that these violations be addressed promptly and rectified to ensure compliance with the law and uphold the principles of fairness and equity. American Express 's assertion regarding the initial denial of my application being attributed to a XXXX  score is deeply concerning. Despite my explicit inquiry in a prior complaint regarding the factors considered by American Express 's underwriting department in determining this denial, my question remains unanswered. Specifically, I requested clarification on the criteria utilized by the Treasury Underwriting department of American Express to assess the application 's outcome. It is disconcerting that American Express attributes the denial solely to a XXXX score, especially considering the utilization of a computerized system for processing applications. This system, as disclosed in your SEC XXXX filing dated XX/XX/XXXX, has been acknowledged by American Express itself as unreliable. Therefore, it is imperative that American Express provide transparent and accurate information regarding the comprehensive factors influencing application decisions, ensuring accountability and fairness in its processes. We rely principally on the customers creditworthiness for repayment of loans or receivables and therefore often have no other recourse for collection. Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired as a result of changes in our underwriting practices or if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. This may be exacerbated to the extent information we have historically relied upon to make credit decisions does not accurately portray a customers creditworthiness, including as a result of the current high rates of inflation and economic slowdown. ( XXXX Filing, dated XX/XX/XXXX, Pg 34 ) Our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including the use of personal information, flaws in our models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, and our ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. ( XXXX Filing, dated XX/XX/XXXX, Pg 27 ) Once more, I must insist on clarity regarding the factors underlying the initial denial of my application. Given the acknowledgment of potential biases and inaccuracies within American Express 's computerized systems, it is imperative to understand the precise criteria influencing such decisions. The reliance on these systems, as previously noted in American Express 's own disclosures, raises concerns regarding discriminatory practices directed towards me as a consumer. This further substantiates my previous assertion regarding American Express 's violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1691 ). Furthermore, I find it necessary to address American Express 's request for my social security number during the application process. Despite the assertion of using it for identity verification, it is crucial to highlight that this request was made under false pretenses. The Social Security Administration 's clarification unequivocally states that the social security number is not intended as a personal identifier for verification purposes. Therefore, by providing my social security number and signature, I inadvertently engaged in a barter transaction. American Express 's insistence on the necessity of providing my social security number under the guise of identity verification is not only misleading but also inaccurate. This practice warrants scrutiny and rectification to ensure compliance with applicable laws and to uphold the integrity of consumer rights. The social security administration even states that The SSN is the single most widely used record identifier for both government and the private sector, exerting a broad influence on the lives of most Americans. However, by itself, it is not a personal identifier because it lacks systematic assignment to every person and the means to authenticate a person 's identity. You can see this for yourself by visiting their website, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Upon signing and submitting the application, I assumed the role of an investor in American Express. The application, also denoted as a note in accordance with the company 's prospectus, is slated for transfer by American Express Receivables Financing Corporation. Following this transfer, the funds will be deposited into the American Express Credit Account XXXX XXXX, in accordance with the specifications outlined in the American Express Prospectus, dated XX/XX/XXXX, specifically on Page 104, Section Sale of Receivables. The act of providing my social security number during the application process to American Express gave Power of Attorney and fiduciary status upon them.The duties of a fiduciary, as outlined in 29 U.S. Code 1104, mandate acting solely in the best interest of the beneficiary. It appears that American Express is not fulfilling this duty, and as a result, I will revoke your status as fiduciary and notify the appropriate authorities. The inclusion of my social security number in the application effectively transformed the transaction into a barter exchange. By providing this information, I conferred something of monetary value to American Express. Subsequently, American Express will leverage this data to generate receivables, converting them into cash before transferring and depositing the funds into the American Express Credit Account XXXX XXXX. This application, in essence, serves as a security. American Express has already transferred and continues to profit from its securitization, alongside card member loans and receivables, as disclosed in the 'Asset Securitization ' section of the American Express XXXX filing on page 118. The occurrence of a barter transaction in the securitization process mandates American Express to complete an IRS 1099B form for this transaction. This action underscores American Express 's divergence from its publicly filed SEC filings, particularly the XXXX form, where American Express explicitly states "" We are subject to significant supervision and regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering ( AML ), countering the financing of terrorism ( CFT ), sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML/CFT , sanctions and anti-corruption compliance could have material financial, legal and reputational consequences Filing an IRS form 1099B for this barter transaction would not only be erroneous but could also be construed as facilitating tax evasion and engaging in money laundering practices. A legitimate barter transaction entails a fair exchange of goods or services. In this case, I provided American Express with a security, yet they have retained it without providing any reciprocal benefit. Instead, American Express continues to trade the security and retain the proceeds for their own gain. This behavior contradicts the principle of fair trade and can not be equated with a lawful exchange. Therefore, submitting a 1099B form would be misleading and potentially fraudulent. I am fully committed to informing the IRS of this discrepancy and ensuring that appropriate action is taken. I have also pulled American Express Charter report dated XX/XX/XXXX, and in this report it states The OCC has not identified that this institution or any affiliate whose loans have been considered as part of the institutions lending performance has engaged in discriminatory or other illegal credit practices that require consideration in this evaluation. Now with that being said the OCC also states that in the same charter report The OCC will consider any information that this institution engaged in discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, identified by or provided to the OCC before the end of the institutions next performance evaluation in that subsequent evaluation, even if the information concerns activities that occurred during the evaluation period addressed in this performance evaluation. I am fully prepared to report American Express to the Office Of the Comptroller. Under FINRA regulations, American Express is engaging in securities fraud by retaining my security and withholding all proceeds and interest associated with it. This conduct directly contravenes the Securities Act of 1933, The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, The Trust Indenture Act of 1934, and numerous other statutes. It is imperative for American Express to comprehend that I am fully prepared to pursue legal recourse. I am poised to lodge formal complaints with regulatory bodies including the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, FINRA, SEC, IRS, Civil Penalty Complaint, Federal Trade Commission, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, among others, to ensure accountability for defrauding consumers. American Express must promptly either approve my consumer credit request or retract my application, bearing my original signature and containing non-public information that I do not authorize for sale or transfer to third parties. Failure to retract my application, containing sensitive information, will also breach the privacy act as per the FTC 's guidelines. Below, I have provided a comprehensive list of laws and definitions for American Express to carefully review and consider in relation to the current situation. Please take the time to thoroughly assess these regulations and definitions. I must emphasize that this will be my final communication regarding this matter. Any outcome other than the immediate approval of my application or the retraction of my original application will necessitate further legal action. This complaint serves as formal notice of my intentions moving forward. ___________________________ Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act TITLE X Subtitle A Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection ( c ) OVERALL ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OF FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.Except to the extent that enforcement of the requirements imposed under this title is specifically committed to some other Government agency under any of paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 8 ) of subsection ( a ), and subject to subtitle B of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Trade Commission shall be authorized to enforce such requirements.

06/16/18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with rewards from credit card,"Note : there's a TLDR version at the bottom CFPB has identified opportunities for credit card issuers to improve the transparency & fairness of their products. But did American Express pay attention? At least my case suggests it didn't, apart from coughing up the fines that CFPB imposed on it. 

How far are credit card issuers allowed to go to hide key facts about their rewards programs, and then come up with the 'my-card-my-rules ' excuse when questioned regarding something not covered by the Terms & Conditions of the rewards program? Is there some sort of a line to be crossed? Or do credit card issuers have complete leeway over cheating their customers by including some text in their 'fine-print ' that gives them freedom from consumer-protection-regulation over their rewards programs? 


CFPB 's former Director, XXXX XXXX, remarked at the CARD Act field hearing in XX/XX/XXXX, "" we are concerned about the quality of disclosures that are made about rewards products. Many consumers are picking their credit cards based on rewards programs. These offers, however, can be highly complex, as consumers may face detailed and confusing rules about how they can actually use their rewards. We will be reviewing whether rewards disclosures are being made in a clear and transparent manner, and we will consider whether additional protections are needed ''.

In XX/XX/XXXX, he said, "" We are also concerned about certain aspects of rewards programs. According to our research, over half of all consumers say they select credit cards based on the rewards they provide. They are lured by the promise of airline miles, hotel visits, points toward purchases, and a variety of other attractive offers. But the specific terms of rewards programs are often not available to consumers until after they have already applied for the card. Even then, the terms of rewards tend to be obscured by glossy program guides, which provide only partial information. Once people are enrolled, they may face detailed and confusing rules about how they can  actually use their rewards. And if consumers were to find, read, and understand the terms, they would often discover that issuers retain the right to change those terms at any time and for any reason ''. 


American Express ' rewards program, Membership Rewards, has temporarily revoked my ability to redeem Membership Rewards points. The reason provided to me was 'Your account is currently being reviewed to make sure that all qualifying purchases meet qualifying criteria '. It seems totally fine for a credit card issuer to hold off points redemption until it verifies a customer 's purchases, except that the date I last received some of those points was XX/XX/XXXX, and today 's XX/XX/XXXX, but I was told verifying transaction would take 6-10 weeks, and there's no way to expedite the process! 

No reason was provided as to why this account-review action was triggered, and why it takes 6-10 weeks to verify a few transactions. 


American Express has a dedicated Membership Rewards team. I talked to one of its supervisors on XX/XX/XXXX who told me that his team has no way to reach out to the 'clerical team ', which 'd actually verify my transactions, so this process can't be expedited. 

An American Express Customer Care supervisor also said, on XX/XX/XXXX, that she had no way of expediting the process of verifying transactions. 


My concern is that first American Express dupes prospective customers into signing up for Membership Rewards points, and then freezes their points without any explanation, just asking them to wait for 6-10 weeks! This wait-period of 6-10 weeks isn't mentioned in the Terms & Conditions, so it seems to be covered by the overarching 'If we in our sole discretion determine  that you have engaged in abuse, misuse or gaming in connection with earning or using points or that you may attempt to do so, we may temporarily suspend your ability to redeem points '. However all my transactions are legitimate. My complaint is not that American Express is not letting me use Membership Rewards points until it verifies my transactions, but that nowehere in the terms & conditions does American Express even vaguely mention that it can take 6-10 weeks to review the transactions of an account. The only fraud being committed here is by American Express! 


While the decision to revoke my ability to redeem MR points may seem discretionary on the part of American Express, I've attached my monthly statement, so that you may verify if even one of my transactions stands to be fraudulent. After those 6-10 weeks ( or given my pathetic experience with Amex, even more ), when American Express would find that all my transactions are legitimate, it would either let me resume redeeming my Membership Rewards points without offering as much as an apology ( as an aside, even their apologies are a euphemistic way of asking one to go XXXX oneself, so they mean nothing to me ), or it would continue to hold onto them, without any explanation. 


It may seem ludicrous, but there's a remote possibility that American Express may have revoked my ability to use Membership Rewards points, as I had been complaining about it on XXXX, and have started using their cards as sparingly as I can, in protest of its execrable customer service. But retaliating against me for exercising my rights as a consumer by complaining to you & the FTC regarding deceptive privacy & data security claims may not sound as ridiculous ( I'll be registering this complaint & evidence later today, about which I had informed American Express on XXXX XXXX ). 


TLDR : 1. CFPB had advised credit card issuers to improve the transparency & fairness of their products, but American Express seems to be looking the other way.

# NoTransparency # NoFairness 2. How long can the CFPB & the FTC allow credit card issuers to operate by the 'my-card-my-rules ' maxim without strong regulation to protect consumers?

3. My card 's & Membership Rewards ' terms & conditions do not mention anything regarding a 6-10 week delay in verification of transactions, during which one can't redeem one 's Membership Rewards points. # NoTransparency 4. No reason was provided as to why a review was triggred to verify my account 's transactions, and I was explicitly told that there's no way to know the reason.

# NoTransparency # NoFairness 5. I think that if Machine Learning algorithms underpin the account-review-triggering process, they may be biased ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ).

My destination was XXXX for travel between XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>. I contacted XXXX XXXX  via XXXX on XX/XX/year> requesting a change in flights from my departure on XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/year>. The person I spoke to in this regard was somewhat aggressive during the call and made multiple requests for spelling my name, even though he spoke and understood English at an above average level he seemed to want an antagonistic transaction. The price for this change was {$340.00}, which I agreed to but at the billing stage he requested my home address which I felt uncomfortable providing stating my credit card company would only require my zip code. 
He then stated if I did not want to provide an address I could always call back for another service provider. I said ok and canceled my request for changing flights and hung the phone up. 

The following day, XX/XX/year> I received a message from my bank indicating the use of my credit card and as a result I became suspicious and reviewed my account. I noted a pending charge in the amount of {$1000.00}. I contacted my bank immediately and advised I had not authorized any payments, and they stated the billing was from XXXX. I explained the situation and they initiated a fraud investigation and reissued a new card. 

I then reviewed my XXXX account and seen they had charged me the {$1000.00} for a XX/XX/year> flight, while at the same time cancelling my XX/XX/year> flight and cancelling my requested flight change for XX/XX/year>. The attached documentation indicates these actions were done the night before, on XX/XX/year>. I then contacted XXXX and spoke to an associate before requesting the aid of a supervisor named XXXX, which reviewed the account and stated they needed to start an investigation on this matter asap. XXXX then advised me that a manager would contact me to further the investigation. 

Approximately 30 minutes later a gentleman named XXXX called, he stated he was the manager and asked what was my issue. I then instructed XXXX what the employee had done with my credit card and they needed to fix this problem. XXXX continued requesting I cancel the XX/XX/year> flight, which I stated I was not going to do anything because I did not purchase a new flight, and any charge on my credit card was not authorized, and it was his job to correct the mistake. 
At a certain point it became obvious XXXX and XXXX had no intention of making good on this matter, and in fact, stated they would issue a refund in the amount of {$340.00} for the XX/XX/year> ticket. I became frustrated to XXXX XXXX of cursing him, and as a result XXXX hung the phone up. 

Approximately 30 minutes later XXXX called back to negotiate a compromise. He then asked if I still wanted the XX/XX/year> flight, which stated yes. He then advised me to cancel the XX/XX/year> flight and he would then confirm the XX/XX/year> flight. I again advised him that I would not cancel an unauthorized purchase, and that it was his responsibility to follow policy on unauthorized purchases. XXXX than asked what would satisfy my travel needs, which I replied, please repair the unauthorized purchases of {$1000.00}, and change the original XX/XX/year> flight to XX/XX/year> without cost to me for the continued disturbance to my vacation, and the consequences of questionable behavior by XXXX employees. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX I had my first correspondence with XXXX XXXX XXXX employee, XXXX. I requested the status of my flight home, which XXXX stated I had no departing flights scheduled and that this matter had already escalated to the higher department for proper handling, and that I would be informed within 30 to 60 minutes with an expected update that never happened. These chats would continue over the course of weeks with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and back to XXXX XXXX Further, documents of cancellations with dates and times from XXXX  app is attached for review.

I made an attempt to dispute this matter with the alleged creditors who informed me that they only report it and that I would have to contact the credit bureaus to have them further investigate with the courts. After contacting the courts, PACER, and the creditors all three have advised that they do not confirm public records with the Credit Reporting Agencies, do not guarantee that any public record information is accurate, or convey information directly with the credit bureau. This is Equifax continued blatant disregard of my demands to remove inaccurate or unverifiable information on my credit report pursuant to the Fair Credit Report Act 15 USC 1681. There is also incomplete information reflected on my credit report that the credit bureau has failed to update as well. That information is demanded to be updated or removed from the credit profile and credit report immediately pursuant to federal law ( FCRA ). The fact is Equifax understands that I am in the process of disputing items whether directly through a credit repair company or through myself. It is my contention that Equifax is participating in deceptive practices because they have removed information from my credit profile that hinders me from being able to see information to ensure information is accurate. Not showing data on my credit report related to payment history, and other important information constitutes as incomplete information. It is my contention that Equifax is hiding this information because every item they keep on my credit report they profit from regardless of whether it is inaccurate, unverifiable, or incomplete. It is my opinion and strong contention that based on the actions taken ( or lack thereof ) by Equifax, they are participating in criminal activity violating federal law.

I clearly authorized LexisNexis to block, delete, and suppress any and all information that was being accessed, sold, or shared with any company, third-party entity, or agency not explicitly listed and approved by me.

I am invoking the following legal provisions in support of this complaint : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681b Limits the circumstances under which consumer reporting agencies may furnish consumer reports.

FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 Right of consumers to block and remove information resulting from identity theft.

FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681g Mandates full disclosure of all information in the consumer 's file upon request.

Federal Trade Commission Act ( FTC Act ), 15 U.S.C. 4158 Prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.

Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a Protects against unauthorized disclosure of personal data held by federal agencies.

Better Business Bureau Guidelines Require ethical data handling and transparent consumer practices. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Establishes a duty to exercise reasonable care in disclosing personal information. 

Furthermore, I am explicitly stating that any and all disputes regarding this issue must not be reviewed, processed, or decided upon by automated systems, including but not limited to artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, or the E-Oscar platform. My dispute and any supporting documentation must be reviewed by a qualified human analyst and responded to in writing, either by physical mail or through verifiable electronic communication. 

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau launch a formal investigation into LexisNexis 's failure to comply with federal privacy and consumer protection laws. Additionally, I ask that LexisNexis be required to provide a detailed audit trail and written report indicating the source, usage, and distribution of all disputed data and proof of full suppression and deletion of any unauthorized information. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am available to provide additional documentation or testimony if necessary.",None,LEXISNEXIS,OH,43613,None,Consent provided,Web,05/30/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,13805055
